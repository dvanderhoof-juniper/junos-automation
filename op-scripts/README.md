# Junos Automation Scripts 

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

The scripts in this folder are designed to be run directly on JunOS devices in operational mode.  

Note that the minimum tested version is JunOS 21.4R3-S5.

### [interface-status.py](interface-status.py) 

A JunOS-ified version of the Cisco and Arista "show interface status command" for switches.

This script attempts to resolve the negotiatied link speed and state first.  If this is not available, it will fall back to the interface link speed.

If possible, inserted transceivers will be displayed. If it is not able to resolve a transceiver from inventory, it will fall back to the interface level media type (typically Copper or Fiber).
If a native VLAN is set on a trunk port, the native/untagged VLAN will be listed under the VLAN column

This script (mostly) only supports enterprise style configurations for VLAN resolution, where unit 0 is the sole unit on the port.
Service Provider style LACP interfaces will attempt to resolve the parent interface, but no VLAN tagging information will be available.
Pure layer 3 (family inet or inet6) interfaces will be displayed as routed, also with only unit 0 supported.

```

## Install

Copy the script file to /var/db/scripts/op on your JunOS device.

Add the following configuration to the device:

```
set system scripts language python3
set system scripts op file <filename> [command <alias>]
```

The command alias is optional and the script can always be run directly via the filename.

## Usage

To execute an op script, run the following command from operational mode

```
op [script-name|command-alias] [arguments]
```

Not all scripts accept arguments.

## Remote Execution

All of the included op scripts can be run remotely via netconf over ssh, using the default port 830

To remotely execute the script, pass in the following environment variables

```
- JUNOS_HOST - Hostname or IP address of the dvice
- JUNOS_USERNAME - Local or remote username for RPC access
- JUNOS_PASSWORD - Password (pubkey auth not currently supported)
```
